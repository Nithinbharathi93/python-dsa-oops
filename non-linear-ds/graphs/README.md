# Graphs
## combination of vertices and edges 

**Usage** - Social media application

**Graph** - Directed and Undirected

 - Directed (Uni-directed graph) - Twitter 
 - Directed (Bi-directed graph) - Instagram
 - Undirectde Graph - LinkedIn Connections

Island and Forest - Graph Concepts


1. Connected Graph: All nodes are somehow connected directly/indirectly
2. Disconnected / Non-Connected Graph: Few parts of the graphs are not connected in that condition, it is called Islands

Group of Islands are called Forest 


## Weighted graph and Non-weighted graph
*Weighted Graph* - Every edge will have a cost

## Cyclic and Acyclic Graph
*Cyclic graphs* - Cycles will be present in the graph
*Acyclic graphs* 
    - Cycles will **not** be present in the graph
    - All trees are *acyclic* graphs
