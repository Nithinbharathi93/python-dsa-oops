Heap DS 
It is a type of tree 
We'll also use heap in graph based algorithm

A special type of Binary Tree which full fils a particular type of property, makes it as a heap.
Types: 
 - Max heap
 - Min heap 

MAX HEAP
      15
    /   \
  10     12    
 / \     / \
5   2   1   6

Every parent node's value should be greater than its children
Root will always contains the greatest number of the list

MIN HEAP
      2
    /   \
  3      6    
 / \    / \
8  10  15  18

Every parent node's value should be smaller than its children
Root node always contains the smalest number of list

Given a list [10, 20, 1, 4, 5]
"Heapify"
Max heap = 
      20
    /    \
  10      5    
 / \    
1   4
