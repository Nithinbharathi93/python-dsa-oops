# Dynamic Programming

## Greedy Algorithm
Once chosen, then we can't revert back. Choosing the best of the available. 

**Example 1** 

You are given wiht 10 choices and you can see all the possible solutions. Then we will obviously choose the best option.
That __the best__ solution is **The Optimal Solution**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Dynamic programming will always offers you the best and omst optimal solution**

## Approachs
* __Memorization approach__: We will solve once and use it again and again
* __Top-down approach__

## Common Problem
* Knapsack Problem
* Fibonacci
