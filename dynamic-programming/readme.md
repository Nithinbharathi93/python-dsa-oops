# Dynamic Programming

## Greedy Algorithm
Once chosen, then we can't revert back. Choosing the best of the available. 

**Example 1** 

You are given wiht 10 choices and you can see all the possible solutions. Then we will obviously choose the best option.
That __the best__ solution is **The Optimal Solution**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Dynamic programming will always offers you the best and omst optimal solution**

## Approachs
* __Memorization approach__: We will solve once and use it again and again
* __Top-down approach__

## Common Problem
* Knapsack Problem
* Fibonacci

Tow important properties of Dynamic Programming are _Optimal Substructure_ and _Overlapping Sub-problems_
* **Optimal Sub-Structure**: To divide the problems and finding the optimal solution for that particular sub problem.
* **Overlapping Sub-problem**: Once a sub problem is solved and thus it can be <span style="color:#00ffff">re-used</span> in other parts
